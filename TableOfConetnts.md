**Goal:** Learn hooks, forms, lifting state, and side effects.

1. **Forms Handling**
   * Controlled vs Uncontrolled inputs
   * `onSubmit` handling
2. **Lifting State Up**
   * Sharing state between components
3. **React Hooks**

   * Route params and `useNavigate`
2. **Fetching Data**
   * `fetch` or `axios`
   * `useEffect` for API calls

3. **React.memo, useMemo, useCallback**
4. **Error Boundaries**
5. **Testing React components (Jest + React Testing Library)**
6. **Mini Project:** Theme Toggler App, Reusable Modal Component

### ✅ **Phase 5: State Management & Ecosystem**

**Goal:** Use tools and libraries for large apps.

1. **Redux Toolkit (RTK)**
   * Setup and usage
   * Actions, reducers, and slices
2. **React Query or SWR**
3. **TypeScript with React (optional)**
